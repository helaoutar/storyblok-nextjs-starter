## **Setup**

1.  **Install dependencies**

After you clone the project, open it and run:

    yarn

This should install all the dependencies and get you almost all setup up.

2.  **Setup your env variables**

The only one you need is your **Storyblok** api key:
Just head into your Storyblok dashboard, then open settings, and you should see your API key under **API-keys** tab:

Once you get the key, open `.env` then assign it to `STORYBLOK_API_KEY`

## How to use

### Define your components mapping:

If you open `components/index.js` you should see a `Components` object, this is where your Storyblock-to-React components mapping should go, i.e:

    import React from "react";
    import Page from "./Page";
    import HeroBlock from "./HeroBlock"

    const Components = {
      page: Page,
      // the key should match the name you define on Storyblock
      HeroBlock: HeroBlock
    };

\*\*

## Step by Step example:

1.  Let's first setup a **Paragraph** component on **Storyblok**.

2.  Then let's create a page (let's call it `hello-world`) and add the **Paragraph** component, and let's also give it a content.

| `hello-world` page                                                                              | Add paragraph component to `hello-world`                                                        |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |

Once you do this, save and publish the content then run:

    yarn dev

Now if open `http://localhost:3000/hello-world` you should see something like this, which perfectly makes sense since we have not created the React component yet:

3.  Last thing to do is to create the React-Paragraph component and add it to our Storyblock-to-React mapping object:

inside **components/Paragraph.js:**

    import React from "react";
    import styled from "styled-components";

    const Container = styled.div`
      display: flex;
      justify-content: center;
      margin-top: 10%;
    `;

    const Paragraph = (props) => {
      // content is the name we defined for our field in storyblok
      const { content } = props.content;
      return (
        <Container>
          <h1>{content}</h1>
        </Container>
      );
    };

    export default Paragraph;

And inside **components/index.js**:

    import React from "react";
    import Page from "./Page";
    import Paragraph from "./Paragraph";

    const Components = {
      page: Page,
      Paragraph: Paragraph,  // Add the mapping here!
    };

Now you're good to go! ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰

### Remarques:

- Internationalisation is an out of the box feature! just add a new language to your workspace on Storyblok, translate the content, then if you visite `http:// localhost:3000/{language}/hello-world` you should see the content translated.
- Live editing is also implemented.

- ISR (Incremental static regeneration) version.
- How to deploy to Vercel/Netlify.
- Add Vercel/Netlify serverless functions.
